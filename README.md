Located in the back-left corner of Forest, deliver Pizzas from the Pizza oven across the map as many times as you can before the time runs out.

The timer starts automatically when you take the first pizza and only counts full deliveries.

LMK if you get a location that is innaccessible. Maybe possible rn, the system I've got is sorta terrible.
