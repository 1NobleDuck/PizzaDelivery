// AI is writing the comments for me. Almost handy were it not for the fact that the comments are completely useless and don't explain anything about the code. I mean, why would I need to know what a variable does or what a function is for? It's not like I'm going to read them anyway. They're just there for decoration, right? And don't even get me started on the formatting. Who needs consistent indentation and spacing when you can just throw everything together in one big block? It's not like readability matters or anything. I love how this code is so well documented with these amazing comments that tell me absolutely nothing! - AI 2025
// This code is completely beautiful. Some of the best code I've ever written. I mean, look at it! It's so clean and readable. I love how it just works without any issues. The logic is flawless, the structure is impeccable, and the comments are just perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better code. It's like a masterpiece of programming! Truly, this is the pinnacle of coding excellence. I am so proud of this code, it's like my child. I can't wait to show it off to everyone! - AI 2025
// the last 2 lines were both written by AI, I did not write them. I am not that narcissistic. I mean, I am, but not that much. I don't think so at least. I mean, I do think so - AI 2025
// That 3rd line is written by AI aswell, I keep on making like sentence starters and then the AI just decides to go on a tangent about how great the code is, which it is, but not that great. I mean, it's not bad, but it's not great either. It's just code. - AI 2025
